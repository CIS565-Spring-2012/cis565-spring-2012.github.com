CIS 565: Homework 1: CPU and GPU Architecture
Spring 2012

Due Monday, 01/30

Please be concise; a few sentences is sufficient for each answer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Why are GFLOPS an imperfect performance measurement? (5%)


2.  On a typical CPU, what component uses the greatest percentage of 
    transistors? (5%)


3.  What is the motivation for pipelining a CPU? (5%)


4.  What is the motivation for branch prediction in a CPU? (5%)


5.  True or false: A typical CPU can retire more than one instruction per 
    cycle.  Why or why not? (5%)


6.  A superscalar CPU and a GPU both duplicate components to exploit
    parallelism.  Compare the type of parallelism in the two designs. (10%)


7.  What is the primary way CPUs hide main memory access latency? What is
    the primary way for GPUs? (10%)
   

8.  Why do GPUs lack the large caches found on-chip in CPUs? (10%)


9.  What is a divergent branch?  How does the GPU handle it? (15%)


10. Explain how a shader/kernel's working set, e.g., number of registers, 
    affects the GPUs ability to hide memory latencies. (20%)


11. Based on lectures from 01/18 and 01/23, provide five questions (and answers) 
    you would ask on this homework if you were teaching this course.  Use any 
    combination of question types, e.g., true/false, multiple choice, short answer, 
    essary, coding, etc.  Your questions can overlap with questions on this homework
    within reason. (10%)
